Siege Support Utilities
-----------------------

Author: Bill Proud <bill.proud@nl.wanadoo.com>
Partly based on Peter Hutnick's bombardment

The siege support utilities consist of the following perl scripts all of which
should be installed in the same directory (such as /usr/local/bin):

prepdata	Processes the siege log outputting a file usable by siegechart
siegechart	Creates a set of charts in PNG format
bombard		Drives siege along with the other two scripts above

Notes:

1. Siegechart requires the following perl modules: Chart-2.x and GD-1.2x
2. Bombard requires a logfile entry to be set in .siegerc

There are also the following man pages which can be installed in for example
/usr/local/man/man1:

siegechart.1
bombard.1
