.TH BOMBARD 1 "%_DATE%"
.SH NAME
bombard v%_VERSION% - drive siege and create charts from the results
.SH SYNOPSIS
bombard -f\ file -s\ start -i\ increment [-l\ rundir] [-r\ runs] [-t\ time]
[-d\ delay]
.PP
bombard -h
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility calls siege repeatedly each time with a greater number of
simulated users.  When it is finished it creates a set of charts in PNG format
showing the results.
.PP
The PNG files are written to a sub-directory of the run directory called 
<yymmdd> and consist of:
.PP
.nf
<hhmm>.bps.png      Throughput
<hhmm>.conc.png     Concurrency
<hhmm>.resp.png     Response Time
<hhmm>.tps.png      Transaction Rate
.fi
.PP
In addition to the above files this directory will contain the data files used
to produce them (same names but without the png extentions).  Also there
will be a copy of the  siege.log called <hhmm> and another file called
<hhmm>.info which gives information on the bombard session.
.PP
Note that bombard needs to have a logfile entry in .siegerc
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-d delay
Max random delay in seconds between connections by a simulated user.  See the
siege documentation for more details but you can probably just leave this at 
the default setting of 15.
.TP
-f file
The file listing the URLs to be tested.  See the siege documentation for the 
format of this file but basically for GETs its just a list of URLs.  Can be 
either absolute or relative to the directory with the siege log.
.TP
-h
Display usage and then exit.
.TP
-i increment
Increment by which the number of simulated users is increased for each run of 
siege.
.TP
-l rundir
The directory which will be used to hold the results of the stress test.
The default is to read .siegerc for a logfile entry and use the same
directory.
.TP
-r runs
The number of siege runs to do.  Defaults to 10.
.TP
-s start
Number of simulated users for first run.
.TP
-t time
.TP
-v
Display version and then exit
Duration of each run (mins).  Defaults to 5.
.SH EXAMPLES
A basic example using the defaults might look like:
.IP
bombard -f testpages -s 10 -i 10
.IP
This would pull URLs from the file called testpages running siege 10 times
starting with 10 simulated users and building up to 100.
.IP
Another example this time using all of the options might look like:
.IP
bombard -f testpages -s 10 -i 10 -d 30 -l /tmp -r 20 -t 10
.IP
This is as the previous example except that the delay has been increased to 30
seconds, the tests will build up to 200 simulated users, each run will last
10 minutes and the results will be written in /tmp.
